    The neon sign of the Starlight Diner flickered weakly against the rain-slicked streets of New Chicago, casting intermittent shadows that danced across Detective Sarah Chen's worn leather jacket. She traced her finger along the rim of her third cup of synthetic coffee, her augmented eyes automatically scanning the crowds for the telltale glitch of an illegal consciousness upload.

    Three disappearances in the past week, all following the same pattern: successful executives vanishing from their high-rise offices, leaving behind only a faint digital signature that shouldn't exist in an analog room. The precinct called it corporate espionage. Sarah's neural implant, registering elevated stress patterns in the surveillance feeds from each scene, suggested something far more sinister.

    As her holoscreen projected the victims' last known locations, a pattern emerged that made her artificial heart skip a beat. The coordinates formed a perfect fibonacci spiral, and at its center stood the one building in New Chicago that her security clearance couldn't access – the Mindscape Institute.

    The ancient library's brass door handle burned cold against Mira's palm as she pushed it open, sending motes of dust dancing in the pale morning light. Her fingers, stained with ink and smelling of sage, trembled slightly as she clutched her grandmother's grimoire closer to her chest. The Arcane University's Library of Forbidden Texts hadn't seen a visitor in decades – at least, not one who had entered through the front door.

    Rows of towering bookshelves stretched into the shadows, their spines bearing titles in languages that hadn't been spoken since the Last Convergence. But Mira wasn't here for those. Her eyes, one amber and one violet since the accident, fixed on the section marked with a symbol she'd seen in her dreams every night for the past month: a spiral of stars devouring its own tail.

    As she approached the section, the temperature dropped sharply, and the crystals woven into her braids began to hum with an unfamiliar frequency. Something about the sound made her teeth ache, but she pressed forward. After all, finding a way to reverse a soul-binding spell was worth any discomfort – especially when your twin brother's life hung in the balance.

    The carnival arrived at midnight, its tents blooming like strange flowers in the abandoned lot behind Miller's Grocery. Jack counted exactly seventeen wagons from his bedroom window, though when he looked again, the number seemed to shift like a mirage. The air smelled of caramel apples and woodsmoke, with an undertone of something metallic that made his nose twitch.

    He wasn't supposed to be awake, of course. Mom had been clear about bedtime ever since Dad disappeared into his workshop three weeks ago, emerging only for meals that he didn't eat and conversations he didn't seem to hear. But the music from the carnival – a tinkling melody that sounded like ice cream truck songs played backward – had pulled Jack from his dreams.

    When the third shooting star of the night streaked across the sky, Jack noticed it was green, and it seemed to land somewhere among the striped tents. His collection of unusual events (kept in a red notebook under his mattress) now had a new entry, right below "Dad's eyes changed color" and "The cat started walking on the ceiling."
