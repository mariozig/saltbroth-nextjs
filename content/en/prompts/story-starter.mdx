    The rain pattered against the windowpane as Dr. Eleanor Wright hunched over her microscope in the dimly lit laboratory. The abandoned research facility on Mars had been her home for six months now, but tonight something felt different. A faint blue glow emanated from the bacterial sample—a glow that shouldn't be there. Eleanor's cybernetic eye whirred softly as it adjusted to the light, capturing every detail of the impossible phenomenon before her. She didn't notice the shadow passing by the hallway behind her, nor did she hear the soft click of the lab door as it locked from the outside.

    The ancient clock tower cast long shadows across Millfield Square as Tobias adjusted his worn leather gloves. Seventy years as the town's most forgettable janitor had served him well—no one questioned why he was anywhere, no one remembered his face, and certainly no one suspected that beneath the municipal building lay the entrance to a labyrinth only he could navigate. Tonight would be his last journey below; the artifact had waited long enough. As he inserted the peculiar key into the maintenance door, a child's laughter echoed through the empty square, stopping his weathered hand mid-turn.
